HTML structures the content of a webpage, while CSS styles it with colors, fonts, and layout. Though often called "languages," they aren't programming languages since they don't handle logic. JavaScript adds interactivity to webpages. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are essential for creating dynamic, user-friendly websites.


HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines webpage structure using elements made up of tags. Tags include an opening tag (e.g., `<p>`) and a closing tag (e.g., `</p>`) that wrap content. Void elements, like `<br>` and `<img>`, don't have closing tags. Correct tag usage ensures better SEO and accessibility, known as semantic HTML.

Every HTML document starts with the same basic structure, called a boilerplate, that sets the foundation for the webpage. First, you declare `<!DOCTYPE html>` to let the browser know you're using HTML5. 

Then, you have an `<html>` element, which holds everything else.

Inside `<html>`, you have the `<head>` section. This is where important info goes—like the page’s title and character encoding—but nothing in the head is visible on the webpage itself. For example, `<meta charset="UTF-8">` ensures special characters display correctly, and `<title>` gives your page a name, which shows in the browser tab.

Next comes the `<body>`, where all your visible content, like text, images, and links, will go. Without anything in the body, the page will appear blank, even though the structure is there.

To see your webpage, you can open the HTML file in your browser—either by dragging it into the browser or double-clicking it. You can also use shortcuts in editors like VSCode to quickly generate this basic structure, but it's useful to learn to write it manually first.
