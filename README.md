HTML VS CSS

HTML structures the content of a webpage, while CSS styles it with colors, fonts, and layout. Though often called "languages," they aren't programming languages since they don't handle logic. JavaScript adds interactivity to webpages. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are essential for creating dynamic, user-friendly websites.



ELEMENTS AND TAGS

HTML defines webpage structure using elements made up of tags. Tags include an opening tag (e.g., <p>) and a closing tag (e.g., </p>) that wrap content. Void elements, like <br> and <img>, don't have closing tags. Correct tag usage ensures better SEO and accessibility, known as semantic HTML.
