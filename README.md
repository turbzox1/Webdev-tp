HTML VS CSS
HTML structures the content of a webpage, while CSS styles it with colors, fonts, and layout. Though often called "languages," they aren't programming languages since they don't handle logic. JavaScript adds interactivity to webpages. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are essential for creating dynamic, user-friendly websites.
